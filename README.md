#Up and Running
1. Follow the instructions on this getting started page, but ignore the `expo init` command as the project is already created in this repo
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started
2. Download the expo client for your phone, or make sure you have xcode installed to run an emulator. Most of what you need to know is in that getting started doc
